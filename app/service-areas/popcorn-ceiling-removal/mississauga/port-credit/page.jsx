        <h2>Local Details for Port Credit Homes</h2>
        <p>
          Port Credit’s lakeside light is beautiful—and unforgiving. Morning sun
          pouring through large windows can highlight ceiling waves and joint
          shadows, especially in older bungalows and side-splits just north and
          east of the marina. Our workflow is designed for{" "}
          <strong>occupied homes</strong>: we isolate work rooms with plastic
          containment, protect hardwood and tile from entry to work area, mask
          vents, and run vacuum-assist sanding to keep dust down while families
          continue their day. If your ceiling texture has been{" "}
          <strong>painted many times</strong>, we’ll test first. When scraping
          risks damage, we use <strong>controlled encapsulation</strong>{" "}
          followed by a full Level 5 skim so the surface reads flat—even under
          raking light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many Port Credit houses have <strong>pot-light upgrades</strong> and
          past patches from electrical or plumbing work. We eliminate
          telegraphing seams by skimming full fields (not just spot repairs),
          feathering wide, and checking from windows and corridor sightlines.
          After inspection, we prime with a{" "}
          <strong>stain-blocking system</strong> to lock down old water marks or
          nicotine. You get a uniform, bright, modern ceiling that’s ready for
          your finish paint (or we can spray the ceiling for you).
        </p>
        <p>
          Home access and parking off <em>Lakeshore Rd E</em> can be tight—our
          crews plan material drops to avoid blocking driveways and we keep
          daily wrap-ups neat so rooms return to use each evening. Communication
          is simple: a clear written scope before we start,{" "}
          <strong>daily photo updates</strong> during the job, and a punch-list
          walk-through before handover. We’re WSIB and liability insured, and
          every project includes a <strong>3-year workmanship warranty</strong>.

        <p>
          We quote <strong>per project</strong> after a short photo review and,
          if needed, a quick on-site confirmation. Price reflects texture type,
          number of paint layers, access, ceiling height, pot-light/patch
          blending, and total square footage. Typical Port Credit homes fall
          within a predictable range once we confirm method (scrape vs
          encapsulate) and final scope. You receive a written plan, start date,
          and daily milestones so you always know what’s next.

            Protect from entry to work area (floor runners/ram board, stairs,
            and doorways).
          </li>
          <li>
            Seal door openings with plastic; mask supply/return vents before
            sanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use vacuum-connected sanders (HEPA) and keep windows/doors
            controlled to avoid dust plumes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Test a small spot first. If scraping risks damage, encapsulate
            texture and proceed to a Level 5 skim.
          </li>
          <li>
            Skim full fields, not just patches, so joints don’t telegraph in
            morning sun or down hallway sightlines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check under raking light from windows and existing fixtures; re-skim
            where needed before primer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prime with a stain-blocking system if there are past leaks or
            nicotine; leave a uniform, paint-ready surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blend around pot-light cutouts and previous repairs so trims sit
            clean and edges don’t flash.
          </li>
          <li>
            Daily tidy: remove debris, sweep/vac pathways, and keep non-work
            rooms usable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simple comms: written scope before start, photo updates during,
