    <h2>Professional wallpaper & popcorn ceiling removal in {city}</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right contractor in {city} can be the difference between walls that look “just ok” and a paint-ready surface that stays smooth for years. We specialize in dust-controlled wallpaper removal, popcorn ceiling removal, drywall installation & repair and interior painting for {city} homeowners. Our crews protect floors and furnishings, isolate the work area, and use extraction sanding so your home stays clean while the work gets done.</p>
    <p>Wallpaper removal is more than pulling paper. We score, steam or soak depending on the wallcovering, remove adhesive safely, then wash the surface to eliminate residue. After removal we repair damaged drywall, skim-coat for flatness, sand with HEPA extraction, prime with a bonding primer and apply quality finish coats. The result: new paint that lays down smoothly without bubbles, flashing or seams.</p>
    <h3>Popcorn ceiling removal done right</h3>
    <p>We contain the room, remove texture, skim as needed, then sand with extraction to control dust. Finally we prime and apply an even ceiling finish. Most ceilings are completed in one to three days, depending on square footage and repairs.</p>

    <p>Every estimate outlines scope, products and warranty so there are no surprises. Typical projects start within 3–7 days and include our <strong>3-year workmanship warranty</strong>.</p>
